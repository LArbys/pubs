swizzle_data This project swizzles the data that has successfully been declared, validated, signed, sealed delivered to SAM. Eventually we will in fact ask also that the beamdaq has been retrieved and merged, but that's only a config change in this project's config chunk. We submit lar jobs to local node only, by-passsing condor altogether for now. 

get_root_metadata This projects opens daq root files that have been moved by the mv_assembler_daq_files project, opens it and extracts some metadata, then stuffs this into and write out a json file.

monitor_machine_resources This projects monitors the resource usage on the machine on which the PUBS daemon is running. It saves a plot of the resource usage.

get_binary_metadata This projects opens daq binary files that have been moved by the mv_assembler_daq_files project, opens it and extracts some metadata, then stuffs this into and write out a json file.

kazu2 This is a project that clearly has nothing to do with production PUBS running, but was created presumably by kazu, or kazu's twin brother, kazu2.

transfer_binary_to_dropbox This project moves a binary file to a dropbox directory for SAM to whisk it away... Status codes: 2 => Copied the file to dropbox.

compare_binary_checksum_near1 This project compares the binary checksum that we have previously gotten from near1.

get_root_checksum_near1 This project takes in the root file located on near1 and gets the checksum of it.

compare_binary_checksum_tape This project compares the checksum that we have previously gotten from the file on tape.

transfer_root_to_dropbox This project moves a root file to a dropbox directory for SAM to whisk it away... Status codes: 2 => Copied the file to dropbox.

get_binary_checksum_near1 This is a project that gets the checksum from a binary file located on near1.

reg_binary_to_sam This process registers the binary file with samweb *.ubdaq and moves it to a dropbox directory for SAM to whisk it away... Status codes: 100 => Cannot find the file to be declared. 101 => File already exists in SAM, email the expert. 2 => Declared the file to SAM. 102 => File doesn't exist at SAM, but failed to declare to SAM. 0 => Validated the file at SAM.

check_binary_on_tape This uses a SAMweb module to check if the binary file is correctly in enstore as we expect it to be.

check_noise_near1 This runs Wes's noise checking script to determine the number of noisy channels in the TPC. The output is stored in a PUBs data directory.

clean_binary_evb This is a project that checks finished jobs on evb and deletes old files.

check_root_on_tape This uses a SAMweb module to check if the root file is correctly in enstore as we expect it to be.

mv_binary_evb This is a project that does an rsync of the binary data file from the evb machine to the near1 machine.

get_binary_checksum_evb This project takes in the binary file located on ecb and gets the checksum of it.

clean_binary_near1 This is a project that takes finished binary files on near1 and deletes old files.

clean_root_near1 This is a project that takes finished root files on near1 and deletes old files.

clean_root_json_near1 This is a project that takes finished root JSON files on near1 and deletes old files.

clean_binary_json_near1 This is a project that takes finished binary files on near1 and deletes old files.

reg_root_to_sam This process registers the root file with samweb *.ubdaq and moves it to a dropbox directory for SAM to whisk it away... Status codes: 100 => Cannot find the file to be declared. 101 => File already exists in SAM, email the expert. 2 => Declared the file to SAM. 102 => File doesn't exist at SAM, but failed to declare to SAM. 0 => Validated the file at SAM.

compare_root_checksum_tape This project compares the root checksum that we have previously gotten from tape.
