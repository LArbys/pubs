This chapter describes about building blocks of {\pubs} framework. Sec.\ref{pubs:model} covers the data process management model and the framework design.
Three following sections \ref{pubs:psql}, \ref{pubs:python}, \ref{pubs:php}
 cover {\psql}, {\python}, and {\php} components as building blocks of the 
framework respectively. More practical development how-to's are discussed 
in the next chapter.
